"Hello, this is *Archie*, an explorer who has stumbled from Electronic and Information Engineering into the world of software.

I once struggled with the anxiety of technical choices and confusion over career paths. It wasn't until I was inspired by Tsoding that I grasped a more fundamental direction: **「Learn systems, not just languages.」**

Technical languages are merely tools; what truly deserves deep exploration are the **systems** they build and operate—whether it's process scheduling in an operating system, the entity-component architecture of a game engine, or the data flow in a distributed service. I started this blog to anchor my thinking and document the process of learning and exploration.

Here, you'll find:

- **⚙️ System Principles:** Inquiries into the essence of computer systems, runtime environments, and frameworks—going far beyond mere syntax.
- **🎮 Creative Logic:** The process of building game demos from scratch, focusing on mechanics, interaction, and the systemic design behind engines.
- **🧭 Mental Models:** Integrating engineering, design, and philosophy to understand and shape the fundamental patterns of the digital world.

This is a blog about 'understanding' and 'creating.' Fellow travelers are welcome."
