**Welcome to ST8-M** — a digital thought and engineering log system built and maintained by Archie. ST8 is the abbreviation for **State**, and **M** carries multiple meanings: it is the **Machine** that records states, the **Manager** that organizes systems, and the **Mechanics** that explores operational principles.

This is an archive for thinking, building, and evolving.

### About The Notes

Notes are the primary content载体 within the ST8-M system, mainly featuring technical analysis articles, engineering practice logs, game design notes, and cross-disciplinary thinking.

#### State Index

Content follows the naming rule `[Type].[Number]-[Title]`. This is not merely a form of order but also a practice of the core idea: "Everything is a state, and everything can be systematized."

| State Code | Full Name & Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`F`** | **Frontend** - Exploration of frontend architecture, interaction engineering, and modern web technology stacks. |
| **`B`** | **Backend** - Thoughts on server-side logic, API design, databases, and distributed systems. |
| **`S`** | **System** - Analysis of system design, toolchains, workflows, and underlying principles. |
| **`G`** | **Game** - Game mechanics design, graphics programming, engine principles, and development logs. |
| **`P`** | **Prototype** - Prototype design, rapid validation, creative technology, and project incubation processes. |
| **`X`** | **Testing** - Testing strategies, automation, quality assurance, and observability practices. |
| **`O`** | **Operations** - Ops, deployment, Infrastructure as Code, and cloud-native technologies. |
| **`U`** | **Linux/Unix** - System philosophy, command-line art, kernel, and open-source ecosystem. |
| **`D`** | **System Design** - Abstraction of complex systems, architectural paradigms, and solution design. |
| **`T`** | **Thought** - Cross-disciplinary thinking, logical deduction, design philosophy, and cognitive fragments. |
| **`L`** | **Log** - Periodic records, project retrospectives, learning trajectories, and阶段性 summaries. |

### About The Jottings

Jottings are a lighter-weight recording space within the ST8-M system, used to capture and share fragmented thoughts, fleeting inspirations, daily observations, or brief insights.

#### State Index

Jottings are not categorized by content type. They are simply serialized using the format `E.[number]-[Title]` and identified via Tags.

### State Transition Invitation

The records here are by-products of personal learning and thinking. If any "state" resonates with you, provides a new perspective, or solves a specific problem, that is its greatest value.

You can interact with the system or trigger new state transitions through the following protocols:
